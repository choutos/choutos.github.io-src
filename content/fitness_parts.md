###And the training started
It may sound easy, but I've been trying to wake up and work out early in the morning, before going to work, for quite a while. I failed miserably every morning, of course. You know what I did instead? Hit the snooze button multiple times. It's a good exercise for your back, arms and shoulders. Every week I rotate sides of the bed, because it's all about symmetry.

But at least I started! Busy as hell with work, studies and doing my best to raise a 3 years old girl; my only option was to wake up before 6am and do some exercise. It's been only the first day but it seems to work pretty well for me. Despite being a bit sleepy while writing this, I feel more energetic and I was even able to finish this week's assigments for a Bioinformatics course I enrolled to. On top of that I am also trying to learn some OCaml programming, preparing all the logistics for the race, fixing the bike... and having a life.


### Bike goodies arrived
It always feels nice to open a box with stuff for your bike, even if it is only a lift stand and some spare parts.

I only need to find time to work on the "beast"... and learn where each bit fits. But we have internet for that, right?
